    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: [Effective Date]</p>

    <p>[Your Game Name] ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information in compliance with privacy regulations such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR-K), and other applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personal information from users of this app.</p>
    <p>We use Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) to display advertisements. To protect the privacy of all users, especially children, we have configured our ads to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve non-personalized ads only.</li>
        <li>Avoid behavioral tracking and personalized ad targeting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party service provider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google AdMob may collect limited technical information (e.g., IP address, device information) to serve non-personalized ads. This data is handled in compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K regulations.</p>
    <p>For more details, refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is designed for users of all ages. However, to ensure maximum privacy protection, we have proactively configured our settings to treat all users as children under the age of 13 (COPPA) or 16 (GDPR-K). This means no personal data is collected for advertising purposes, and only child-appropriate ads are shown.</p>

    <h2>Parental Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian and have any questions or concerns regarding your child’s privacy, please contact us at:</p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:[Your Contact Email]">[Your Contact Email]</a></p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
